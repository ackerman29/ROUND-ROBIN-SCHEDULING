# ROUND-ROBIN-SCHEDULING
Round Robin Scheduling is a CPU scheduling algorithm used in operating systems. It allocates a fixed time slice (quantum) to each process in a circular queue. When a process's quantum expires, it's moved to the back of the queue, allowing other processes to run. This ensures fairness and prevents any single process from monopolizing the CPU.
